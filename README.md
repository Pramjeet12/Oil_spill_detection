## Features

- **Remote Sensing Data Processing**: Utilizes Sentinel-1 SAR data for oil spill detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements a Random Forest model to classify and identify oil spills.
- **Visualization**: Displays detection results and analytics through Google Earth Engine.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to various geographical regions and data sources.

## Technologies Used

- **Remote Sensing Tools**: Google Earth Engine
- **Google Earth Engine**: A powerful cloud-based platform for processing and analyzing geospatial data.
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript

## Dataset

This project primarily uses Sentinel-1 SAR data for oil spill detection. The data can be accessed through the Google Earth Engine catalog.

## Model Training

The Random Forest model is trained using features extracted from the Sentinel-1 SAR data. 

## Results

The model's predictions were validated against ground truth data, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy in identifying oil spills.
