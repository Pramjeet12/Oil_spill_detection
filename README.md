## Introduction

Oil spills can have devastating effects on marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Conventional detection methods often have limited reach and slow response times. This project seeks to improve the speed and accuracy of oil spill detection by utilizing satellite data, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Remote Sensing Tools**: Google Earth Engine.
- **Google Earth Engine**: A powerful cloud-based platform for processing and analyzing geospatial data.
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript.

## Dataset

This project primarily uses Sentinel-1 data for oil spill detection. The data can be easily accessed through the Google Earth Engine catalog.

## Model 

The Random Forest model is trained using features extracted from the Sentinel-1 data. 

## Results

The model predictions were validated against ground truth data, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy in identifying oil spills.
